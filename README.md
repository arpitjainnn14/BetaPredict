# BetaPredict
Developed a Machine Learning–powered Diabetes Prediction System that analyzes key health indicators to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The system leverages classification algorithms for early detection, helping support preventive healthcare and timely intervention.


P.S. This project is a work in progress. I’m actively refining the ML model for diabetes prediction, and a FastAPI deployment pipeline has already been set up to serve the model once finalized.
